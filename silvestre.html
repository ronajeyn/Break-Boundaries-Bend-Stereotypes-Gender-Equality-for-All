  <h1>Equality Beyond Gender: Embracing Leadership, Emotions, and Opportunities for All</h1>
  <div class="card"><div class="Silvestre, Gian Carl Regala.jpeg"></div><a href="gian1.html">Gian Carl R. Silvestre</a></div>

  <p>To me, gender equality means that we must recognize women's potential to lead, we should allow men to express emotions freely, and we will respect non-binary people. It is also about sharing chores and valuing kindness as power. Additionally, we should ensure education and employment offer equal opportunities for all.</p>

  <p>I believe boys and girls don't have equal opportunities because social expectations often dictate their pursuits. Expectations such as these can be what our academic choices are shaped by. For instance, my primary education program is for the most part male, which shows just how gender can impact our decisions.</p>

  <p class="quote">"It starts from the subjects that we can choose in school, and also this imbalance carries onward to the workplace. Some occupations are frequently linked to certain genders."</p>

  <p>I think that men move toward equality when they break away from their customary gender norms. This involves backing of women in leadership roles, equal opportunities are actively promoted, and men are allowed open emotional expression. That stereotype that men always have to be tough should be ditched now.</p>

  <p>Men can foster more balanced relationships now. That is possible if men take on more household as well as childcare responsibilities.</p>

  <p>These barriers must be broken down to build a fairer world of thriving people. With this shift, social constraints would not obstruct people pursuing their passions. Relationships that are respectful plus balanced would result. Ultimately, the change would foster a harmonious society in totality. It would also serve to lead to one that is more inclusive.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Everyone is treated respectfully along with equally whatever their SOGIE is."</p>
