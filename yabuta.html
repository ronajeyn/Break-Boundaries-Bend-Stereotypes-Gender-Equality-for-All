  <p>When I was younger, I did not think too deeply about what it meant to be limited by expectations. I just knew there were some social rules about what boys were good at, what girls should be interested in, and where people who did not quite fit those boxes were expected to stay.</p>

  <p>I remember being in junior high, surrounded by people that casually insisted that math was for boys, that only the “artsy gays” were good at design, and that girls were naturally better at TLE. It was not said with cruelty, just repetition. Just enough to make you feel like those paths had already been decided before anyone really got to choose.</p>

  <p>I never really saw myself going into engineering. Not because I did not want to, I just never imagined it was possible. That is, until I watched my sister walk confidently into the world of IT, a world that, at the time, was almost entirely dominated by men. She did not hesitate. She did not wait for permission. And somehow, watching her and her friends do that made the idea a little less intimidating for me.</p>

  <p>Now that I am studying computer engineering myself, I still see the imbalance, more men than women, and not nearly enough people from the LGBTQIA+ community. But the energy is different now. People are starting to care less about whether you fit the mold and more about what you bring to the table. There is a quiet shift happening, and it is beautiful to be part of it.</p>

  <p class="quote">To me, gender equality is about freedom—the freedom to carry yourself how you want, to dress how you like, to dream of careers that do not come with social expectations. It is about breaking the stereotypes, not bending yourself to fit them.</p>

  <p>And yes, we are making progress. The world feels more inclusive today than it did five or ten years ago. But progress is not just something that happens, it is something we all choose to take part in. My sister chose it when she stepped into a male-dominated field. Her friends chose it. I am choosing it now, in my own quiet way.</p>

  <p class="highlight">If you have never thought much about gender issues, here is what I hope you remember: You do not have to ask for permission to be who you are. Express yourself freely. Wear what makes you feel strong. Study what makes you curious. Do it kindly, and boldly, and without apology. Because gender equality starts with the freedom to be exactly, unapologetically, yourself.</p>
