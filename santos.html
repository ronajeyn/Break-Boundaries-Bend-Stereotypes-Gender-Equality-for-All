  <p>As a student from Generation Z, I’ve grown up in a world that often talks about equality and progress. Yet, I continue to witness how gender inequality remains deeply rooted in both our society and daily lives. Stereotypes and unfair treatment are still part of the experiences many people face—especially in education, work, and social settings.</p>

  <p>Gender equality is not a privilege—it is a right and a shared responsibility. It means giving everyone, regardless of gender, equal opportunities, respect, and the freedom to thrive. While policies and laws are important, real change also comes from small, everyday actions that challenge discrimination and promote fairness.</p>

  <p>Statistics show that women still face unequal participation in the labor market. In most countries, women earn only 60% to 75% of what men earn for the same work. This wage gap is a clear sign of the ongoing imbalance in opportunities and treatment. UNICEF also reports that one in four girls aged 15 to 19 globally are not in education, employment, or training—compared to just one in ten boys. These numbers are not just statistics—they represent real lives affected by inequality.</p>

  <p>Women often face barriers to leadership and decision-making, while men who challenge traditional gender roles are criticized or excluded. True gender equality allows everyone to live without fear, judgment, or limitation based on who they are.</p>

  <p>As a student, I believe awareness starts with us the younger generation. We have the power to speak up, break boundaries, and bend stereotypes.</p>

  <p class="quote">All women and men must first, learn to value themselves, independently of everyone, and everything—because a woman or man who loves and values herself or himself will always have the ability to put an end to violence, discrimination, and injustice.</p>
