  <p>Gender equality has been a big challenge in recent years in society. Women only attained basic rights and freedoms that were denied to them for centuries. After decades of campaigning and struggling for their rights, gender equality was finally heard by the world. Gender equality to me is that all individuals, whether male or female, are entitled to similar rights, duties, and opportunities. It is about education, work, political participation, and social roles fairness. It also includes stereotyping and giving everyone a chance to freely express themselves without discrimination.</p>

  <p>Gender equality is not just a fair idea but actually it is a necessary pillar for a foundation in society. Reflecting on what gender equality means to me, I view it as a unique strength and potential of every individual—regardless of whether they are women, men, non-binary, or any other gender. It is about breaking old stereotypes that determine what individuals can or ought to be able to do based on gender. I believe progress towards gender equality requires the active involvement of all, having women lead and equal opportunities for both sexes are essential steps towards an equitable society.</p>

  <p class="highlight">Finally, gender equality is about creating a world where no one is bound by their gender expression or identity. It is about embracing and appreciating each person's individuality and choice. With gender equality, we are able to create not just fairness but also connection and belongingness.</p>
